# Lazy-Guardian-Project
As many of you know, this discord bot was originally created as an idea for a fun little discord bot until that fateful day, the owners idea changed. He saw his discord bot as an opportunity, an opportunity to help make discord servers safer, not by jut providing simple automoderation or moderation tools, but instead advanced automoderation, next gen, automoderation that would completely change and flip how people were to think about automoderation for discord bots. The owner of this bot believes he can do so, but, he's just one man trying to do the seemingly impossible. If you believe in his dream of creating a superior and most efficiently secure, all purpose discord bot and you wish to contact him (perhaps even discuss becoming a part of his dev team?), you can contact him [here](https://discord.io/TheLoungingArea). His username on discord is @Wintercearig#8773.
