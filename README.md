Hello! This is the Lazy Guardian Project and it's the type of project that I am wanting to turn into something much more. My dream is to create the "perfect" and first of its kind, Discord Super Bot which will be an All Purpose discord bot. I am far ways from getting this done, But, i assure you it is possible, i know it is, and I will not stop until I am finished If you wish to support him or perhaps even join him in the making of this discord super bot, you can contact him [here](https://discord.io/TheLoungingArea "The Lounge"). His username is @Wintercearig#8773 if you wish to contact him directly on discord.

## Made with [Repl.it](https://repl.it.com/ "A super powerful tool!")
Repl.it supports a wide variety of different coding lanuages like C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Node.js, Ruby, Python, HTML, PHP, and much more!
Repl.it is a free-to-use online IDE, compiler, editor, Interpreter, and REPL(read-eval-print loop) and it's perfect to host discord bots, websites, and to create simple or complex programs, but, of course it is if you know what you're doing.
