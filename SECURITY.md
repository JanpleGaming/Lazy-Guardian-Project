## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability and/or a bug or some other problem with the code, plese head on over to [Issues](https://github.com/BlazingWinter/Lazy-Guardian-Project/issues)
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
