## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability and/or a bug or some other problem with the code, plese head on over to [Issues](https://github.com/BlazingWinter/Lazy-Guardian-Project/issues)
You should expect frequent updates with an interval of almost every single day. If the devs see that your vulnerability is of some importance to them then what you should expect is a timely reply from one of our trusty devs explaining that your issue was accepted, will be fixed asap, and they will also thank you for spotting this before something might have happened because of such. If your issue was declined then you should expect to get a reply from one of our devs explaining in detail that it is just a minor issue and we have no immedient priority to fix something so insignificant
